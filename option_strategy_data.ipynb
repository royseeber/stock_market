    "The holding period for all calculations will be 1 week and the expiry date will vary from 1 to 5 weeks out. This will enable us to determine whether holding options through to expiry is the best strategy or if there is some optimal holding period relative to the time remaining on an option.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above option strategies fall into 1 of 3 categories; Bullish, Bearish and Neutral. Choosing a strategy therefore implies an expectation as to the future behavior of the underlying stock. In order to evaluate trades in the context of this expectation, we need to identify the direction in which the market moved for each week in the study. The market_direction field will be derived as follows using the At-The-Money Implied Volatility.\n",
    "- Strong Up - up more than the average expected move (upper 25% of a Normal Distribution)\n",
    "- Neutral Up - up less than the average expected move (between 0% and upper 25% of a Normal Distribution)\n",
    "- Neutral Down - down less than the average expected move (between 0% and lower 25% of a Normal Distribution)\n",
    "- Strong Down - down more than the average expected move (lower 25% of a Normal Distribution)\n",
    "\n",
    "The BigQuery SPY table has a sampling_key field (random number between 0 and 1) associated with each quote record which will help us determine the various returns that can be expected based on the accuracy of a model. To illustrate, consider a binary model that predicts SPY moving either up or down with a 70% accuracy rate. We could simulate this model by having it make correct predictions 70% of the time. In other words, we would have our simulated model predict that SPY will move up if it did in fact move up and the quote record had a sampling_key greater than .3. Likewise our model would predict that SPY will move down if it did in fact move down and the quote record had a sampling_key greater than .3 (note: 70% of random numbers betweeen 0 and 1 will have a value greater than .3). Using this approach we can simulate the expected returns for arbitrary models with various prediction acurracy rates."
